# TODO

## Implement the following features/services
- ~~add a way to buy and sell workplaces and houses~~
- Game event logger for showing a history of game events (people being born, dying, defecting, random encounters, etc.)


## Bugs/Observations
- Once we reach a max population, only the red people will increase. This is wrong because
the current population should have some amount of people defect to red, and then some 
amount of babies, and these should not be the same value.


## Misc
- Get a linter for this project
